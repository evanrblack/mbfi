This is a project for COMP 3410 - Computer Organization and Assembly.

I run and edit it through the MARS emulator, and have not tested it on actual hardware.

Things to do:
*	Fix user input to accept normal strings and then convert them to byte
*	Provide checks for balanced brackets, acceptable cell range
*	Clean it up (repeating code)
*	Standardize register usage
*	Allow for STDin input (if possible in MARS)
